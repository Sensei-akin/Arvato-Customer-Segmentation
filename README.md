# Arvato Customer Segmentation

Capstone project for **Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**, which consists of the analysis of demographic data to rank leads by their propensity to become **Arvato Financial Solutions** customers.

# Installation

This project had been tested with python 3.6, so it's recommended to have an environment with this version of python to make it work.

As this package has `setup.py` aligned with `requirements.txt`, you only need to clone this repository and execute `pip install .` in the root of the project.

It's suggested to have an isolated environment activated before doing pip install (conda, venv, pipenv...).

# How To Run?

Once you have installed all of the requirements, you run the notebooks, first `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` and then `Machine_Learning_Algorithms_For_Kaggle.ipynb`.

You need the data to run this repo, but itÂ´s only available for **Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**, so sorry if you want to test it but for privacy reasons the data is not public.

# Customer Segmentation Report

This project begins by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

# Supervised Learning Model

The previous analysis will be used to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

# Kaggle Competition

Once the model is chosen, it is also used to make predictions about the campaign data as part of a Kaggle competition. Individuals will be ranked by the probability of them becoming customers, and compared to other nanodegree students how it works.
